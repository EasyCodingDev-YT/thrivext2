# JavaScript Essentials for React

## 1. JavaScript definition

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

- **`Lightweight Interpreted :`**  Low level languages are complied language meaning anything you declared in that that language like variable, function etc or suppose you call a function then first of all they check headers (like our import they use #import output etc )  following they will come first then definition of them are setted , then pre-proccessing , assemble , coverts to binary, assemble things will be linked then after fully combined we see the result. So that’s a lot process to get the result. But like in a high level language like javascript after writing a code there is already a interpetor written in another language which interepts the code.
    1. **Complied Language:**  we get the machine code after the whole file is interpeted or complied. 
    2. I**nterpreted Language:** The code in executed line by line by the interpreter. 
        - `*Just in time Compiled :*` Our ram is used as a hot memory. Which contains a Stack memory and heap memory
            1. Stack Memory : It deletes the stored memory after code execution 
            2. Heap Memory : It’s doesn’t deletes the memory it keeps it and after when you call the same function like it checks directly and tell the result. 
- **`First Class Functions :`** In js, if we declare any variable it is undefined by defualt whereas for function a definition is declared and then for the things inside will be declared
- **`Scripting Language :`** JavaScript is a scripting language because it is generally interpreted and used to automate and enhance the functionality of web pages. It provides the dynamic behavior that makes web pages more than just static documents. It allows developers to make web pages interactive.
- **`Enviroments :`**  JavaScript runs in two main environments:
    - **Non-Browser (Server-Side, etc.):**
        - Focus: Backend, applications, more.
        - Examples: Node.js, Electron, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
        - Uses: Server logic, desktop apps, tools.
    - **Browser (Client-Side):**
        - Focus: Web page interactivity.
        - Examples: Chrome, Firefox.
        - Uses: DOM manipulation, user events, AJAX.
- **`Prototype-Based :`** When we declare a Array js will give e shape of array meaning it’s prototype is already ready.
- **`Multi-paradigm :`**  "Multi-paradigm" in the context of JavaScript means that the language supports multiple programming styles or approaches. This gives developers flexibility in how they write their code.  For example : in js or react js we can use both class or functional components.
- **`Single Threded :` JS takes input, output by one thread. Then after taking input and outputs and js send them to the other theeads to run and give a result faster.**
- **`Dynamic Language:`  JS is not strongly type language. So can set any type of contents to a variable. when declare a varible js takes a space for the variable in the memory. Which expands or shriks according if needed according to the variable types which gives us flexlibility in writing code but also creates problems in some cases**
- **`Object-oriented :`**
- **`Imperative:`**
- **`Declarative:`**
